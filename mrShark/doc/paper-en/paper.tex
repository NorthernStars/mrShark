The Mixed-Reality is a robot soccer league, using a half-virtual system for
developing an artifical intelligence (AI) that's playing soccer. Already in use
robots for the system arent't available any more, so a re-development was
necessary. This paper summarizes the result from a bachelor thesis developing
the control logic for a new Mixed-Reality-Robot. It includes a micro-controller
driven control logic and consideres up-to-date small batch production
techniques for choosing proper electronic components and electronic layout.

\section{Introduction}
The Mixed-Reality (MR) bases on a half-virtual robot system for developing AIs
on a soccer scenario. For that small robots with dimension about
$3cm^{2}$ \cite{northernstars:mrshark}, are driving on a screen with simulated
soccer field and simulated soccer ball. One or multiple cameras are tracking the robots using marker codes on their top side. The tracked position is projected
into the simulated soccer field, wich is used for an external agent program that
can remote control the robot using an infrared transmitter system. The advantages of the system are a hardware-independent
framework for AI programming and reduced hardware problems normally occuring
with full reality robot-system, like orientation problems, autonomous working
problems or limited on-robot resources\cite{northernstars:mr-system}.
\newline
\newline
Mixed-Reality robots used in the past where developed and manufactured by the
CITIZEN company\cite{rtlions:faq}. Currently CITIZEN is no more producing new
robots and is not planning to do this in future. These orginal CITIZEN-Robots are titled as old
bots and new developments are titled as new bots. Due to problems with
unavailable components of the old robots and difficult maintance of the
components, a re-development was necessary. That should consider long
avilability of components, easy maintance and cheap small batch production. Also
compatibility of new systems with the old system are needed to enable easy
changing to a new system. A bachelor thesis at the University of Applied
Sciences Kiel worked on this and developed an electronic control circuit with
printed-circuit-board (pcb) for a new bot called mrShark.

% INDUSTRIAL PCB BATCH PRODUCTION TECHNIQURES
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Industrial pcb batch\\ production techniques}
For re-development of a MR-Robot it was important to consider production
techniques to select cost-efficient and highly available components as well as
generating a proper producable pcb layout. In general industrial batch
production of pcbs is divided into two steps, the production of the pcb itself
and the assembly of the electronic components. For the first step the
pcb layout mainly needs to consider dimension and spacings of circuit paths,
where in the seconds step the electronic components playing a major role. They
are influencing the costs for assembling the pcb because of higher programming
costs of the assembly machine for a higher components diversity or using
different assembling techniques as surface mounted devices (SMD) \cite{sautter:88} and
thorugh hole technology (THT) \cite{scheel:97}. Also placeing only a few components on one
side (layer) of the pcb is inefficient due to extra costs for programming the assembly
machine for assembling the second side. The total number of components is also
important due to limitations of the maximum capacity of components storage at
one assembly machine. All this needs to be considered while choosing an
electronic component \cite{eilers:13}.

% REQUIREMENTS FOR mrShark
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Requirements for mrShark}
From the problems of the old bots and the techniques applied during industrial
batch production the following requirements are arising \cite{eilers:13}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Cheap production
  \item Highly available electronic components/devices
  \item Simple programming
  \item Simple extending
  \item Long runtime
  \item Autonomous power supply
  \item Compatibility with existing system
  \item Measurement of relevant system voltages and currents
  \item Optimization in view of industrial small batch productions
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations}
Due to backward compatibility the new system has some limitations as following
\cite{eilers:13}:
\begin{itemize}
  \item PCB dimension max. 31,0x26,0mm (right angle) with 45 degree phase on
  all four edges
  \item Using 2 GM15 dc motors
  \item Remote control via 115,2kBit/s infrared signal
 \end{itemize}

% CONTROL LOGIC
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Control logic}
The control logic of the mrShark robot is used to recieve remote infrared data,
to control the robots motors and to show it's current state. The control logic
is explained in details below.

\section{Concept}
The concept of realising a electronic ciruit was a mircocontroller based
solution with some external integrated circuits (IC) (see figure \ref{fig:concept}) for
controlling the motor voltage and current as well as an infrared to serial
decoder for decoding remote infrared data and some integrated analog to digital
converters (ADC) for mesearuring the relevant voltage. Rgb leds are used to
light up the robots case and to show it's current state. Finally an
interface should be used to extend the system with additional electronics.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\epsfig{file=img/concept.eps, width=3.3in}
\caption{Mixed-Reality robot mrShark electronic circuit concept.}
\label{fig:concept}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Power supply}
The power supply should be able to enable a long autonomous runtime without
recharging. For that two lithium-polymer (LiPo) rechargable batteries are used
in parrellel mode. With that the supply voltage ist between 4.1V and 3.3V\cite{eilers:13}.
The rechargable LiPo-batteries offering a long runtime without any need to replace
them. They have also small dimensions and enabling a high capacity in parallel mode.

\subsection{System interface}
The system interface uses a pin-header in the middle of the robot's pcb to
prodive internal voltages (like battery voltages) and communication data for
external electronics that could get mounted above the control logic's pcb.

\subsection{Components}
As central processing unit an AVR ATmega168 microntroler with 16MB program flash
is used. The microntroler provides enough computing power and program data ram
for analysing incoming remote data streams and measured data. On the other hand
the device integrades often used peripherals with a minimum of power consumption
(see figure \ref{fig:avrsupplycurrent}). The ATmega168 can get replaced with
the ATmega48 or ATmega88 devices with 4MB and 8MB program flash. These optional
devices are cheaper but offer less program memory.

The mrShark control logic also includes an infrared to serial decoder and two
motor drivers, two Twisted-Wire-Interface-Bus (TWI-Bus) ADC are used, as well
as an TWI-Bus Switch to switch between internal and external TWI master devices
in case of using many robots connected together.

The control logic uses a status led and four rgb-leds to illuminate the robot's
case and for providing visual information about the robot's state.

% VALIDATION
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------
\section{Evaluation}
The electronic components used and the layout of the
control logics pcb are selected to  provide a product life-cycle as long as
possible, as well as small batch production costs. For that the worldwide
availability of components, the diversity of component types used and the layout
arrangement of components at the pcb are evaluated. Not rated are state of the
art components like often used resistors and capacitors, because often they are
in-stock products of pcb production companies. The evaluation uses point in
range of 0 to 100 to rate every evaluation item on a fictive production of 150
pcbs \cite{eilers:13}.

For the component availibility the products available at the worldwide
distrubutor Farnell was analysed at august 2013. For that the needed number of
components {n} and the available number of components {k} were used. A
multiplicator {m} indicates the art of availibilty (see equation
\ref{eq:component-availibility}).
For components in Farnell's EU stock {m} is 1.0, for components only available
in Farnell's US stock it is 0.75, if components are only available from other
distrubutor it is 0.5, for components only available from producer it is 0.25 and 0.0 for unavailable
products\cite{eilers:13}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:component-availibility}
P_{1} = \frac{k}{n}*m*100 \text{points}
\end{equation}

For the 17 most important components, an average 91 of 100 points is reached.
Two components are only available from other distributors than Farnell and one
component has the be ordered directly from producer (see figure
\ref{fig:evavailibility}).

\begin{figure}
\centering
\epsfig{file=img/evaluation-availibility.eps, width=3.3in}
\caption{Evaluation points for most important control logic components (by
number).}
\label{fig:evavailibility}
\end{figure}

For component diversity a quotient of different component types {v} and total
number of components {n} is used (see equation \ref{eq:component-diversity}). So
less diversity is rated bettern in case of lower machine programming costs
during production.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:component-diversity}
P_{2} = (1 - \frac{v}{n}) * 100 \text{points}
\end{equation}

For 26 different and total 66 components the mrShark control logic pcb reaches
an average 61 of 100 points \cite{eilers:13}.

For the evaluation of the pcb's layout the number of components on each side of
the 2-layer pcb, as well as the number of different orientations are used (see
equation \ref{eq:component-layout}). Where $n_{MINOR}$ is the number of components on the pcb
side with the least number of these components and $n_{MAJOR}$ the number of
components on the other side. The multiplicator {m} is 1.0 if all
components of one type having the same orientation. For every additional
orientation it is decreased by 0.25.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:component-layout}
P_{3} = \frac{n_{MINOR}}{n_{MAJOR}}*m*100 \text{points}
\end{equation}

The average number of points of the pcb's components layout is 87 of 100 points,
where 5 from total 26 component types have two different orientations and 3
component types have more than two different orientations \cite{eilers:13}.

The average of all three evaluation aspects, availibilty ($P_{1}$), diversity
($P_{2}$) and layout ($P_{3}$) is 80 of 100 points (see equation
\ref{eq:evaluation-total}) \cite{eilers:13}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:evaluation-total}
P = \frac{ P_{1} + P_{2} + P_{3} }{ 300 \text{points} } * 100 \text{points}
\end{equation}

\section{Conclusion}
The developed control logic for the new Mixed-Reality robot mrShark offers
control of two DC-motors via infrared interface. The choosen micocontroller AVR
ATmega168 provides enough computing power and memory storage for complex
programs. The additional periphery offers possibilities to control different
volatges and a system interface provides the possibility to extend the system
with additional electronic circuits. The selected components used for the pcb and
their layout on the pcb are analysed and evaluated for small batch productions
with an overall good result. With these features the mrShark can be used as
replacement system for old Mixed-Relaity robots.
